## 2022 Typescript

The good:

- Type system is quite lovely. You can type arbitrary data structures and tooling works great.
- I had several "wow, I can't believe that worked on the first try" moments. Not sure if it is the language or luck.

The bad:

- Lack of a standard lib with queues, priority queues, etc is also really annoying. I guess there are NPM packages for that.
- `for x of` vs `for x in` caused many bugs...

The ugly:

- Javscript is kinda horrible for advent of code, `[1,2] == [1,2]` is false is one of many examples
